# Fluorescent Coding Challenge

This is a take-home challenge for Fluorescent Design Inc.
Please view the finished page [here](http://www.google.com)

## Overview

The challenge was to develop a piece of a theme product page based on a design prototype and a list of requirements.

## Notes

For this challenge I focused more on getting the design as close to the prototype as possible/ following the requirements and less on developing dynamically created elements which would be the next step.  

### Stack

CSS, HTML, JavaScript, jQuery
